Γ£û Check Expo config for common issues
You have an app.json file in your project, but your app.config.js is not using the values from it.
Advice:
Remove the static app.json, or use its values in your dynamic app.config.js. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration

Γ£û Check that no duplicate dependencies are installed
Your project contains duplicate native module dependencies, which should be de-duplicated.
Native builds may only contain one version of any given native module, and having multiple versions of a single Native module installed may lead to unexpected build errors.
Found duplicates for expo-constants:
  Γö£ΓöÇ expo-constants@18.0.10 (at: node_modules\expo-constants)
  ΓööΓöÇ expo-constants@18.0.12 (at: node_modules\expo\node_modules\expo-constants)
Advice:
Resolve your dependency issues and deduplicate your dependencies. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/resolving-dependency-issues

Γ£û Check for app config fields that may not be synced in a non-CNG project
This project contains native project folders but also has native configuration properties in app.config.js, indicating it is configured to use Prebuild. When the android/ios folders are present, EAS Build will not sync the following properties: orientation, userInterfaceStyle, ios, android, plugins, scheme. 


Γ£û Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
  Untested on New Architecture: react-native-geolocation-service
  Unmaintained: react-native-geolocation-service
Advice:
Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.

Γ£û Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
