# Assets Folder

This folder is for storing app assets like images, icons, and other static files.

## Optional Assets

The following assets are referenced in `app.config.js` but are optional:

- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (for web builds)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (optional, uses default if not provided)

## Adding Assets

You can add your custom assets here. The `assetBundlePatterns` in `app.config.js` is set to `["**/*"]` which includes all files in this directory.

## Current Status

- Assets folder created
- Asset files are optional - app will work without them
- Add your custom assets as needed
